GULP:A node.js tool which helps automate your build process

go to node.js cmd-->go into your project folder-->

npm init-->create a package .json file-->this contains info about the packages being used by that file

then install the packages-->

npm install gulp gulp-react gulp-concat --save

gulp-react-->helps convert the jsx into compilable javascript
gulp-concat-->concats the different jsx files into one file

npm install gulp-cli -g-->this command enables us to use gulp from the command line..ie.we can do somthing like

-->gulp -v -->this gives us a version of gulp installed

whenever we run a gulp inside a folder...gulp looks for a file called gulpfile.js-->this is the file on which gulp works on
and automates build tasks.

gulpfile.js:

var gulp=require("gulp"),
    react=require("gulp-react"),
    concat=require("gulp-concat");

//gulp immediately executes a task which is set as default

gulp.task("default",function(){
     //asking gulp to look for all the files inside the src folder
      return gulp.src("src/**")

         //pipe is like the next course of action.This command tels gulp to convert all into js executable files
             .pipe(react())

          //tells gulp to concat all thse files and store it in a single file called application.js
             .pipe(concat('application.js'))

          //this sets the destination where this file should be located.
             .pipe(gulp.dest('./'))
});


STEPS TO AUTOMATE TASKS:

1)go to your folder directory eg:in my case react.js is the name of my folder
2)create a folder called src where you create mulitple jsx files each of whihc holds a different react component.
eg
 src:
   thumbnail.jsx
   thumbnailList.jsx
    button.jsx
    app.jsx

3)go to node.js cmd....go to react.js folder-->npm init-->creates package .json file
4)npm install gulp gulp-react gulp-concat --save
5)npm install gulp-cli -g
6)create a file called gulpfile.js inside react.js folder.This file is used by gulp to automate tasks.
7)Execute gulp in command line
8)a file is created in the desired destination..in the above case application.js file is created.
8)go to index.html-->delete jsx transformer script tag and add <script src="application.js"></script>

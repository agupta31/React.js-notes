JSX-extension of javascript which lets us write html inside javascript.

{
   render:function(){
      return 
  <div>
     <p>hello</p>  ----->html inside javascript function
  </div>
  }
}
//
since we cannot compile html inside js we need to convert into a compilable form:

{
  render:function(){
        return React.createElement("div",null,"hello world");
   }
}


react class-describes the form and function of the react component but does not provide any functionality.It itself cannot be used
in the DOM.It must be first instantiated and then render that instantiated copy in the DOM.

react library-->storehouse for core libraries which is used to define the react classes and react components
react dom library-->it is used for DOM manipulations in which we render a react component on the DOM.
<script>
    

  var helloWorld=React.createClass({
        render:function(){
             return <div>
                   hello
               </div>
           }
});-->created a react class-->this must always have a render method which must always return a jsx

  var element=React.createElement(helloworld);--instantiated the class to be used in the DOM


</script>
